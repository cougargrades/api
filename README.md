# @cougargrades/web
[indev] University of Houston service for students

## Indev âš 
cougar-grades is in private early development and the master branch will get very dirty as a result. This means commits probably won't work if cloned and tried building because undocumented changes could've been made.

## Project modules
- `importer/` Python script to process a collection of CSV files into .db and .sql files for importing into the webserver module
- `mariadb/` MariaDB Docker image that imports the .sql files produced by `importer/`
- `webserver/` Node.js webserver to run the website using [fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/)

### Webserver
[indev]

## Dependencies
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- `make`
- Grade data (only one is required):
    - in CSV format with the schema seen in `sample/sample.csv`
- At least ~500MB in space (Docker images)
    - mariadb:latest (~349MB)
    - redis:5.0-alpine (~30.9MB)

## Running
- `cd cougar-grades/`
- Generate SQLite and SQL files: `./generate.sh [directory with csvfiles | csvfile] --cleanup`
    - `records.db` and a `records.sql` files will be copied to `cougar-grades/` before deleting the container and images generated
- Start MariaDB and Redis in Docker: `make start` (ports 3001 and 3002)
    - Stop with `make stop`
- cd `webserver/`
- Webserver dependencies: `npm install`
- Start webserver: `npm start` (port 3000)
