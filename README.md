# @cougargrades/api
Serverless public developer HTTP API server for cougargrades.io

## Indev âš 
cougar-grades is in private early development and the master branch will get very dirty as a result. This means commits probably won't work if cloned and tried building because undocumented changes could've been made.

## Building: API Server (Firebase Cloud Functions + Express.js)
- `cd functions/`
- `npm install`
- `firebase serve --only functions`
